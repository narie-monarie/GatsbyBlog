# Linked Lists

- What are linked Lists 
 - like arrays they are dynamic Data Structures
 - I am going to create a linked list in Typescript because it is easy to understand
 ```ts
    class Node<T> {
     data: T;
     next: Node<T> | null = null;

     constructor(data: T) {
       this.data = data;
     }
   }
 ```
 - The code above represents one node like [4] then the next, is a pointer to the next node in that its [4]->
