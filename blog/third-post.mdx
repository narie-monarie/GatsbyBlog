- The reason why I prefer google sheets to Excel, is:
    - Its free (although there's a case for this)
    - For someone who uses linux, I have no access to Excel
    - Easier to use online than excel
    
- All these points make Google sheet look good but, there's also Microsoft excel online the issue is u need to have a microsoft account online which is very tiresome to create. 
- With google sheets all u need is a google account and your data is saved every time.
